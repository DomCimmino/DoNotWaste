# Energy Benchmarking and Optimization Tools Comparison

This repository contains a project developed as part of the Computer and Electronic Engineering degree program. The project is built using ASP.NET MVC and is aimed at comparing and analyzing energy benchmarking and optimization tools. The primary objective is to highlight the differences between these tools and provide insights to users, aiding them in selecting the most suitable tool for their energy optimization needs.

## Features

- **Comparison of Tools:** The project facilitates the comparison of various energy benchmarking and optimization tools.
  
- **Analysis:** Detailed analysis is provided to highlight the differences and effectiveness of each tool.

- **User Guidance:** Users are provided with insights to help them make informed decisions about selecting the most suitable energy optimization tool.

- **Integration with ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager Test Environment:** The project utilizes APIs from the ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager's test environment to fetch and analyze energy performance data, ensuring that the analysis is based on reliable and standardized data.

- **Integration with Asset Score API:** The project also leverages the Building Energy Asset Score API, which evaluates energy performance based on the physical structure and internal systems of a building. This feature adds another layer of analysis, focusing on the building's potential for energy efficiency improvements regardless of current energy consumption.

## Technologies Used

- C#
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript

## APIs Used

- **ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager Test Environment API:** The project integrates with the test environment APIs provided by ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager. These APIs allow the project to retrieve energy performance data, generate reports, and perform various analyses to compare and optimize energy usage. The use of these APIs ensures that the data and analyses are accurate and adhere to industry standards.

- **Asset Score API:** This project also utilizes the Building Energy Asset Score API, developed by the U.S. Department of Energy. This API evaluates the energy performance of buildings based on their physical characteristics and internal systems. The Asset Score API uses advanced simulation tools like EnergyPlus to generate energy use intensity data and evaluate lifecycle costs. This integration allows the project to offer a comprehensive comparison by incorporating both real-world energy consumption data and potential energy efficiency based on building design.

By leveraging these APIs, the project can seamlessly integrate real-world energy performance data alongside theoretical energy efficiency analyses, providing users with practical and comprehensive insights. The use of both ENERGY STAR and Asset Score APIs allows for a more complete understanding of how different tools measure and compare energy performance, offering users actionable recommendations for energy optimization.
